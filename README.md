# cricket-watcher

I've been a keen player and watcher of cricket since childhood, and really enjoy watching professional games live. I was curious about questions like "what's the highest score I've seen live?" and "who have I seen take the most wickets?" so I thought I'd build a project to answer them.

To start with, it'll just have hardwired data about matches I've seen, but the logic should equally apply to any given set of matches so maybe I'll generalise it one day.

Cricket lends itself to bespoke and complex queries, so I chose to use GraphQL for its flexibility.

### Usage ###

To run the project locally:

`
npm start
`

Then navigate to localhost:3000/dev/graphql to use the GraphQL playground.
